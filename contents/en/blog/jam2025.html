<p>The theme for the event is: UNION ‚à™üç§!</p>
<p>It can mean:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The act of uniting or the state of being united</li>
  <li>Union between 2 people, for example marriage or civil union</li>
  <li>Union among many people, for example a trade union or a union of countries (e.g. EU)</li>
  <li>In mathematics, when you combine two or more sets</li>
  <li>And many more related meanings üòâ you can even make an acronym from U.N.I.O.N.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interpret it as literally or as loosely as you want! Feel free to discuss ideas in forum or on <a href="https://discord.gg/3tVdM5H8cC">Discord</a>.</p>
